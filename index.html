                  April 2019 I joined the flatbed company TMC. I traveled out to Des Moines, IA to attain my Class A CDL, and secure a position with the company.
                  I had no clue on what to expet. I didn't know anything about trucks, trailers, or the struggles I would encounter. My goal was to be a sponge, 
                  and come in with the mindset that no matter what I'll return home a TMC trucker. There were many challenges I faced. My hardest challenge was 
                  shifting. I have never driven a manual before, and struggled with the concept of double clutching. Performing backing maneuvers was the next 
                  challenge I had to overcome. It was to a point were I tried to avoid having to back up because of my lack of confidence in my skill. Five 
                  years later I'm working as a Driver Trainer for Ryder. I have been accident free my entire career in the industry, and I've been awarded for 
                  being a safe driver.

                  Around the time I was preparing to attain my CDL, I was told about a program that teaches people skills to help land positions in the tech 
                  industy. That person told me I would be a great fit, and that I would do well if I chose to make the transition. The program that was mentioned
                  was LaunchCode. Being the person that I am I chose to stay the path of attaining my CDL. I'm the type of person that if I gave someone my word 
                  or commitment that I would like to see it through. Although I made the decision to stay the course I always kept that thought in the back of my 
                  mind. I got to a point in my career where I felt that I did everything that the trucking industry had to offer. I wanted to be challenged. I 
                  wanted a lifestyle that gave me more time for my family. I started looking into what I could do while I working a hectic schedule. I stumbled 
                  across Google's career certificate program. I completed the IT Support certificate, and started to work on the IT Automation with Python 
                  certificate. Once my schedule aligned, I enrolled into LaunchCode's web dev program.
